# Multimodal House Price Prediction (Tabular + Images)
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict house prices using:

Location features

Engineered tabular features

Optional image embeddings extracted using a pretrained CNN

The goal is to compare classical ML vs multimodal learning and determine whether visual information improves price prediction.
