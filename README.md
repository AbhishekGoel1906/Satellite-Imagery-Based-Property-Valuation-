## 🚀 Project Setup (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📊 Data Setup

### Tabular Dataset
Place the main CSV file inside:
```
data/raw/
```

Example:
```
data/raw/real_estate_data.csv
```

The dataset should contain:
- Latitude & Longitude
- Property attributes (area, rooms, age, etc.)
- Target variable (price)

---

### Satellite Images & Embeddings

You may already have images and embeddings stored on **Google Drive**.

#### Option A: Google Colab (Recommended for Large Data)
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Update paths inside the notebooks to point to your Drive folders.

#### Option B: Local Execution
Place files manually:
```
data/images/
data/embeddings/
```

⚠️ **Do NOT push images or embeddings to GitHub.**

## 🧪 Running the Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```bash
jupyter notebook Preprocessing.ipynb
```

This step:
- Cleans missing values
- Performs feature engineering
- Applies log transformations
- Saves processed data to `data/processed/`

---

### Step 2: Model Training & Evaluation
```bash
jupyter notebook model_training.ipynb
```

This step:
- Trains tabular baseline models
- Performs multimodal fusion with embeddings
- Uses cross-validation
- Evaluates using RMSE and R²

Outputs:
```
models/    → saved trained models
results/   → metrics, plots, evaluation results
```

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
- Cross-Validation Mean & Standard Deviation
- Model comparison visualizations

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility
- Fixed random seeds
- Deterministic data splits
- Saved embeddings and trained models
- Same preprocessing pipeline for all runs

---

## 🛑 Common Pitfalls
- Ensure ID columns match between tabular data and embeddings
- Apply log-transforms consistently
- Avoid committing large files to GitHub

---

## 🔮 Future Work
- Transformer-based image encoders
- CNN fine-tuning on domain-specific data
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Real-time inference pipeline
