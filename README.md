## 📊 Data Setup

### Tabular Dataset

Place the real estate dataset excel file inside:
```
data
```

Example:
```
data/train.xlsx
```

### Dataset Description

Each row represents a residential property with the following attributes:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique property identifier |
| `date` | Date of sale |
| `price` | Sale price (target variable) |
| `bedrooms` | Number of bedrooms |
| `bathrooms` | Number of bathrooms |
| `sqft_living` | Living area in square feet |
| `sqft_lot` | Lot size in square feet |
| `floors` | Number of floors |
| `waterfront` | Waterfront presence (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| `view` | Quality of view (ordinal) |
| `condition` | Overall condition rating |
| `grade` | Construction and design grade |
| `sqft_above` | Square feet above ground |
| `sqft_basement` | Square feet of basement |
| `yr_built` | Year the house was built |
| `yr_renovated` | Year of renovation (0 if none) |
| `zipcode` | Postal code |
| `lat` | Latitude |
| `long` | Longitude |
| `sqft_living15` | Living area of nearby homes |
| `sqft_lot15` | Lot size of nearby homes |

The **target variable** for prediction is:
```
price
```

## 🛰️ Satellite Images & Embeddings

Satellite imagery is used to capture **neighborhood-level and environmental context**.

Extract satellite images and CNN embeddings through data_fetcher.py and store them on **Google Drive** to avoid recoumputation everytime.

### Option A: Google Colab (Recommended for Large Image Data)
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Update image and embedding paths inside the notebooks to point to your Drive directories.

---

### Option B: Local Execution

If running locally, place files as follows:
```
data/images/        # Satellite images (e.g., <id>.jpg)
data/embeddings/    # CNN embeddings (.npy or .parquet)
```


---

## 🧪 Running the Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```bash
jupyter notebook Preprocessing.ipynb
```

This step performs:
- Missing value handling
- Feature engineering (ratios, age, log transforms)
- Geographic feature processing (lat-long usage)

---

### Step 2: Model Training & Evaluation
```bash
jupyter notebook model_training.ipynb
```

This step:
- Trains tabular baseline regression models
- Integrates satellite image embeddings for multimodal learning
- Evaluates models using RMSE and R²

Running the preprocessing and training pipelines generates the following outputs **locally inside the project directories**.  
⚠️ **Files are not automatically downloaded or exported outside the project environment.**

### 📄 Prediction Outputs
- A CSV file containing model predictions is generated after training:
```
predictions.csv
```
This file includes:
- Property `id`
- Predicted `price`

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
- Tabular vs Multimodal performance comparison

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility

To ensure reproducibility:
- Fixed random seeds are used
- Deterministic train-validation splits
- Saved CNN embeddings and trained models
- Identical preprocessing pipeline across runs

---

## 🛑 Common Pitfalls

- Ensure property `id` matches between tabular data and satellite images
- Apply log transformation to `price` consistently during training and evaluation
- Avoid committing large binary files (images, embeddings) to GitHub

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Fine-tuning CNNs on real estate imagery
- Transformer-based vision models
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Deployment-ready inference pipeline
